# Valuation of Stolen Diamonds from Gringotts Wizarding Bank
## Predictive Analysis of the Lapidarist Problem
This work provides a detailed analysis of the lapidarist problem, focusing on valuing stolen diamonds from Gringotts Wizarding Bank. The study involved exploring and cleaning a dataset of 53,930
diamonds. Advanced predictive models, including Epsilon-Support Vector Regression (SVR), were developed, with the SVR model achieving the best performance (RMSE of 594.79). The estimated total
value of the stolen diamonds was $ 43,630.37 Â± $ 1,880.88, nearly double the average value of a random selection of diamonds. The report highlights the complexity of the theft and suggests that those involved had expert knowledge of diamond valuation.
